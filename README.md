bruteForceKeyGenerator
======================

Simple brute force key generator to open a url. I wrote this as an exercise for an interview and it will generate
keys of any length until a correct key is found.  In this particular implementation all keys with start with a 'Q'
and will contain a '9'. But it recurisvly generates all possible combinations of a given string so it is quite slow.
It is easy to modiify the length and given character set though.
